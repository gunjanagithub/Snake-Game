# Important Concepts from `snakeGame.js`

## 1. Event Listeners
- Used to capture user input (e.g., `keydown` events for controlling the snake).
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  window.addEventListener('keydown', e => {
      switch (e.key) {
          case "ArrowUp":
              inputDir.x = 0;
              inputDir.y = -1;
              break;
          // Other cases...
      }
  });
  ```

## 2. Game Loop
- The game loop is responsible for updating the game state and rendering the game at regular intervals.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  function main(ctime) {
      window.requestAnimationFrame(main);
      if ((ctime - lastPaintTime) / 1000 < 1 / speed) return;
      lastPaintTime = ctime;
      gameEngine();
  }
  ```

## 3. Collision Detection
- Used to check if the snake has collided with itself or the walls.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  function isCollide(snake) {
      for (let i = 1; i < snake.length; i++) {
          if (snake[i].x === snake[0].x && snake[i].y === snake[0].y) return true;
      }
      if (snake[0].x >= 18 || snake[0].x <= 0 || snake[0].y >= 18 || snake[0].y <= 0) return true;
      return false;
  }
  ```

## 4. Rendering the Snake
- Used to display the snake on the game board.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  snakeArr.forEach((e, index) => {
      let snakeElement = document.createElement('div');
      snakeElement.style.gridRowStart = e.y;
      snakeElement.style.gridColumnStart = e.x;
      snakeElement.classList.add(index === 0 ? 'head' : 'snake');
      board.appendChild(snakeElement);
  });

  snakeArr[i + 1] = { ...snakeArr[i] };
  ```

## 5. Food Generation
- Used to randomly place food on the game board.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const foodSound = new Audio('food.mp3');
  foodSound.play();

  food = {
      x: Math.round(2 + (16 - 2) * Math.random()),
      y: Math.round(2 + (16 - 2) * Math.random())
  };
  ```
